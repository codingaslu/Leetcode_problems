Write a Python function `sumsquare(l)` that takes a nonempty list of integers as input and returns a list `[odd,even]`, where `odd` is the sum of squares all the odd numbers in `l` and `even` is the sum of squares of all the even numbers in `l`.

**Sample Input**

```
[1,3,5]
```

**Output**

```python
