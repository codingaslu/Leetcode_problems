## Live Coding Problem 2

Write a function **del_char(s,c)** that takes strings `s` and `c`  as input, where `c` has length 1 (i.e., a single character), and returns the string obtained by deleting all occurrences of `c` in `s`. If `c` has length other than 1, the function should return `s`.

**Sample input-1**

```
banana
b
```

**Output**

```
anana
```

**Sample input-2**

```
banana
an
```

**Output**
