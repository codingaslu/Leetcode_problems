## Live Coding Problem 1

A positive integer `m` is a prime product if it can be written as `p Ã— q`, where `p` and `q` are both primes. .

Write a Python function **prime_product(m)** that takes an integer `m` as input and returns `True` if `m` is a prime product and `False` otherwise. (If `m` is not positive, function should return `False`.)

**Sample Input**

```
6
```

**Output**

```
True
```
